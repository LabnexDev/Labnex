# Performance Optimization Guide

## Bundle Size Issues Found:
- Total bundle size: 4.92 MB (CRITICAL)
- Largest chunks:
  - vendor-a-m-CAXLbEex.js: 1.02 MB (markdown-related)
  - vendor-n-z-BFgNGucV.js: 639.56 KB
  - utils-html2canvas-BOCi_7Iu.js: 194.13 KB

## Optimizations Applied:
1. âœ… Replaced static imports with dynamic imports
2. âœ… Implemented lazy loading for heavy components
3. âœ… Added aggressive code splitting in Vite config
4. âœ… Enabled tree shaking and minification

## Next Steps:
1. ðŸš¨ Replace react-markdown with lighter alternative (marked + DOMPurify)
2. ðŸš¨ Consider replacing html2canvas with native screenshot API
3. ðŸš¨ Lazy load non-critical pages and features
4. ðŸš¨ Implement route-based code splitting

## Quick Wins:
- Use `<Suspense>` boundaries around heavy components
- Implement progressive loading for images
- Enable gzip/brotli compression on server
- Use CDN for third-party libraries

## Monitoring:
- Run `npm run analyze:simple` to check bundle size
- Run `npm run wall-check` to validate performance
- Use Lighthouse for real-world performance testing
