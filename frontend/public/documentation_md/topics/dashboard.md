### Navigating from the Dashboard

The Dashboard facilitates quick navigation:

*   Click the "View Details" button on a recently updated project to go to its specific page.
*   Use the "View All Projects" link or button to go to the main project listing.
*   The main sidebar (usually on the left) remains your primary tool for navigating to other sections like "Projects", "My Tasks", "Notes", "Snippets", or "Settings".

The Labnex Dashboard aims to be your starting point for effectively managing your development and testing lifecycle.
