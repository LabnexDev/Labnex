[2025-05-31 12:15:12] [AI] Reasoning: The selector '#userEmail' is a CSS selector that targets an element with the id 'userEmail'. This is the most robust and efficient way to select the element as IDs are unique within a page and are the fastest way to select an element.

[2025-05-31 12:15:17] [AI] Reasoning: Based on the descriptive term 'the Current Address field', it's likely that the field has an ID of 'currentAddress', similar to the 'userName' and 'userEmail' fields. However, the provided DOM snippet does not include the actual element, so this is an educated guess.
