        *   Total Active Projects
        *   Your Assigned Tasks (Open/Pending)
        *   Team Member Count (if applicable to your view)
        *   Recent Notifications Count
*   **My Tasks Overview**:
    *   A section listing tasks currently assigned to you, often with quick filters for status (e.g., To Do, In Progress).
    *   Direct links to view task details or the relevant project.
*   **Recently Updated Projects**:
    *   A list of projects that have seen recent activity (e.g., new tasks, updated test cases, new comments).
    *   Helps you stay informed about ongoing work.
*   **Activity Feed** (if implemented):
    *   A chronological log of important events across your projects, such as:
        *   New project members.
        *   Task status changes.
        *   Test case results.

### Navigating from the Dashboard

The Dashboard is designed for quick insights and navigation:

*   Click on project names to go directly to the Project Details page.
*   Click on task titles to view task details.
*   Use the main sidebar (usually on the left) to navigate to other sections like "Projects", "My Tasks", "Notes", "Snippets", or "Settings".

### Customization (if available)

*   Some dashboards might offer customization options, allowing you to choose which widgets or information are displayed. Check your user settings or dashboard options.

Spend some time familiarizing yourself with the Dashboard layout and the information it provides. It's a great starting point for your daily work in Labnex.
