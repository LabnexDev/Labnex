# API Reference (Overview)

This document provides an overview of the Labnex API. For detailed endpoint specifications, please refer to our forthcoming interactive API documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI).

## Introduction

The Labnex API allows developers to interact with Labnex data and functionalities programmatically. This can be used to build integrations, automate workflows, or create custom tools.

**(Placeholder: The actual API is not yet defined or implemented. The content below is a general structure for what would be included once an API exists.)**

## Base URL

(Placeholder: `https://api.labnex.dev/v1` - This will be defined once the API is live.)

## Authentication

(Placeholder: Describe authentication mechanism, e.g., API Keys, OAuth 2.0)

-   **API Keys**: Requests to the Labnex API are authenticated using API keys. You can generate and manage your API keys from your Labnex account settings under the "API" section.
-   **Header**: Include your API key in the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` scheme:
    `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`

## Rate Limiting

(Placeholder: Describe rate limiting policies)

-   To ensure fair usage and stability, the API has rate limits. Exceeding these limits will result in `429 Too Many Requests` error responses.
-   Standard limits might be X requests per minute and Y requests per hour per API key.
-   Check response headers for `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, and `X-RateLimit-Reset` for current rate limit status.

## API Versioning

The API is versioned. The current version is `v1`. Versioning is handled through the URL (e.g., `/v1/projects`). Breaking changes will be introduced in new versions.

## General Principles

-   **Data Format**: The API accepts and returns data in JSON format.
-   **HTTP Verbs**: Standard HTTP verbs are used:
    -   `GET`: Retrieve resources.
    -   `POST`: Create new resources.
    -   `PUT` / `PATCH`: Update existing resources.
    -   `DELETE`: Remove resources.
-   **Error Handling**: Standard HTTP status codes are used to indicate the success or failure of a request. Error responses will include a JSON body with an error code and message.
    -   `200 OK`: Request successful.
    -   `201 Created`: Resource created successfully.
    -   `204 No Content`: Request successful, no response body (e.g., for DELETE).
    -   `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request (e.g., missing parameters, validation error).
    -   `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication failed or not provided.
    -   `403 Forbidden`: Authenticated user does not have permission.
    -   `404 Not Found`: Resource not found.
    -   `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded.
    -   `500 Internal Server Error`: Server-side error.

## Core Resources (Examples - To Be Detailed)

-   **Projects**: `/projects`, `/projects/{projectId}`
-   **Tasks**: `/tasks`, `/tasks/{taskId}`, `/projects/{projectId}/tasks`
-   **Test Cases**: `/testcases`, `/testcases/{testCaseId}`
-   **Notes**: `/notes`, `/notes/{noteId}`
-   **Users**: `/users`, `/users/{userId}` (Potentially limited for privacy)
