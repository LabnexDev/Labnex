# Developer Guide (Contributing to Labnex)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Labnex! This guide provides information to help you get started with the development environment, understand our coding standards, and navigate the contribution process.

**(Placeholder: This guide assumes Labnex is an open-source project or has a clear path for community contributions. Specific details depend on the project's actual nature.)**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   **Git**: For version control.
-   **Node.js & npm/yarn**: For frontend development (e.g., Node.js >= 18.x).
-   **(Backend Specifics)**: (e.g., Python with Poetry, Java with Maven, Go, etc. - Specify backend stack requirements here.)
-   **Docker (Optional but Recommended)**: For containerizing services and ensuring a consistent development environment.
-   An IDE/Text Editor of your choice (e.g., VS Code).

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1.  **Fork & Clone the Repository**:
    -   Fork the main Labnex repository on GitHub/GitLab.
    -   Clone your fork locally: `git clone <your_fork_url>`
    -   Navigate into the project directory: `cd Labnex`
    -   Add the upstream repository: `git remote add upstream <main_repo_url>`

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    -   **Frontend**: Navigate to `frontend/` and run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
    -   **Backend**: (Provide instructions specific to the backend, e.g., `cd backend/ && poetry install`)

3.  **Environment Variables**:
    -   Copy example environment files (e.g., `.env.example` to `.env`) in both `frontend/` and `backend/` (or root, depending on structure).
    -   Fill in necessary variables (API keys for services, database connection strings, etc.). Some may have defaults suitable for local development.

4.  **Database Setup (If Applicable)**:
    -   (Provide instructions for setting up the local database, e.g., using Docker Compose to spin up a PostgreSQL/MongoDB instance, running migrations.)

5.  **Running the Application Locally**:
    -   **Frontend**: `cd frontend/ && npm run dev` (or `yarn dev`)
    -   **Backend**: (Provide command, e.g., `cd backend/ && poetry run uvicorn main:app --reload`)
    -   Access the application at `http://localhost:xxxx` (frontend) and ensure the backend is running on its configured port.

## Codebase Overview

(Placeholder: Briefly describe the main directories and their purpose, e.g., `frontend/src/`, `backend/app/`, `docs/`, etc. Refer to `STRUCTURE.md` for a more detailed view if it exists at the root.)

-   **`frontend/`**: Contains the React-based user interface.
    -   `src/api/`: API service integrations.
    -   `src/components/`: Reusable UI components.
    -   `src/pages/`: Top-level page components.
    -   `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks.
-   **`backend/`**: (Structure depends on the chosen backend framework, e.g., routes, controllers, models, services.)
-   **`documentation_md/`**: Markdown files for the in-app documentation system.

## Coding Standards & Conventions

-   **Language Specifics**: Follow established best practices for TypeScript/JavaScript (frontend) and the backend language (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).
-   **Formatting**: Use Prettier and ESLint (for frontend) or equivalent linters/formatters for the backend. Configuration files should be present in the repository. Run formatters before committing.
-   **Naming Conventions**: Adhere to the naming conventions outlined in the Global Development Rules (PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables).
-   **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests for new features and bug fixes. (Specify testing frameworks, e.g., Jest, React Testing Library for frontend; PyTest, JUnit for backend).
-   **Commit Messages**: Follow conventional commit guidelines (e.g., `feat: Add new login button`, `fix: Correct user authentication flow`).

## Contribution Process

1.  **Find an Issue**: Look for open issues on the issue tracker. If you want to work on something new, consider creating an issue first to discuss it with the maintainers.
2.  **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch from the `main` or `develop` branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-new-feature` or `fix/bug-description`.
3.  **Develop**: Write your code, including tests and documentation as needed.
4.  **Test**: Run all tests to ensure no regressions were introduced.
5.  **Lint & Format**: Ensure your code adheres to linting and formatting standards.
6.  **Commit**: Commit your changes with clear and descriptive messages.
7.  **Push**: Push your branch to your fork: `git push origin feat/my-new-feature`.
8.  **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: Open a PR from your fork's branch to the `main` or `develop` branch of the upstream Labnex repository.
    -   Provide a clear description of the changes in the PR.
    -   Link any relevant issues.
9.  **Code Review**: Project maintainers will review your PR. Address any feedback or requested changes.
10. **Merge**: Once approved, your PR will be merged.

## Communication

-   **Discord/Slack/Community Forum**: (Specify primary communication channels for developers.)
-   **Issue Tracker**: For discussing specific bugs or features.
