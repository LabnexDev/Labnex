# Notes & Code Snippets

Labnex provides dedicated spaces for capturing important textual information (Notes) and reusable pieces of code (Code Snippets). These features help you keep project-related information organized and easily accessible.

## Notes

Notes are ideal for jotting down ideas, meeting minutes, requirements, research findings, or any textual information relevant to your projects or general workflow.

**Accessing Notes:**
*   Navigate to the "My Notes" section from the main sidebar. This page lists all your notes.
*   You can filter notes by the project they are linked to, or view notes not linked to any specific project.

**Creating a New Note:**
1.  On the "My Notes" page, click the "Add Note" button.
2.  A modal will appear where you can enter:
    *   **Content** (Required): The main body of your note, entered into a text area. The system may use the first few words of your content to generate a display title for the note. (Markdown for formatting may be supported).
    *   **Project (Optional)**: You can link the note to a specific project.
3.  **Save Note**: Click "Save" or "Create".

**Creating a Note with AI:**
1.  On the "My Notes" page, click the "AI Assistant" button.
2.  A modal will appear where you can enter:
    *   **Prompt**: Describe the note you want the AI to generate.
    *   **Project (Optional)**: Link the AI-generated note to a specific project.
3.  Click "Generate" or similar. The AI will create the note content based on your prompt.

**Managing Notes:**
*   **Viewing/Editing**: Notes are displayed typically showing their content. Click the "Edit" icon on a note to open a modal where you can modify its content and project linking.
*   **Deleting**: Click the "Delete" icon on a note (usually with a confirmation step).

## Code Snippets

Code Snippets allow you to store, manage, and share reusable blocks of code. This is useful for frequently used functions, configuration examples, templates, or any code segment you might need again.

**Accessing Code Snippets:**
*   Navigate to the "Code Snippets" section from the main sidebar.
*   This page will list your saved code snippets, often displaying the title, language, and a preview of the code.

**Creating a New Code Snippet:**
1.  On the "Code Snippets" page, click the "Add Snippet" button.
2.  A modal will appear where you can enter:
    *   **Title** (Required): A clear title for the snippet.
    *   **Language** (Required): Select the programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python). This enables syntax highlighting.
    *   **Code** (Required): Paste or type your code into the code editor area.
    *   **Description (Optional)**: Briefly explain what the snippet does.
    *   **Project (Optional)**: Link the snippet to a relevant project.
3.  **Save Snippet**: Click "Save" or "Create".

**Managing Code Snippets:**
*   **Viewing/Editing**: Snippets are displayed with syntax highlighting. Click the "Edit" icon on a snippet to open a modal where you can modify its details.
*   **Deleting**: Click the "Delete" icon on a snippet (usually with a confirmation).
*   **AI Assistance**: For each snippet, you may find "Cleanup" and "Fix Errors" buttons.
    *   **Cleanup with AI**: Attempts to reformat or improve the style of your code.
    *   **Fix Errors with AI**: Attempts to identify and correct potential bugs in your code.
    *   AI suggestions are typically shown in a separate modal or view.
*   **Syntax Highlighting**: Code is displayed with syntax highlighting based on the selected language for better readability.

By using Notes and Code Snippets effectively, you can build a valuable knowledge base for yourself and your team.
