## Notes & Code Snippets in Labnex

Labnex provides dedicated spaces for capturing important textual information (Notes) and reusable pieces of code (Code Snippets). These features help you keep project-related information organized and easily accessible, both for individual use and team collaboration.

### Notes

Notes are ideal for jotting down ideas, meeting minutes, requirements, research findings, or any textual information relevant to your projects or general workflow.

**Accessing Notes:**
*   Navigate to the "Notes" section from the main sidebar. This usually takes you to a page listing all your notes.
*   You can often filter notes by the project they are linked to, or view notes not linked to any specific project.

**Creating a New Note:**
1.  In the Notes section, look for a "Create Note", "New Note", or "+" button.
2.  A form or modal will appear where you can enter:
    *   **Title**: A descriptive title for your note.
    *   **Content**: The main body of your note. This is typically a rich text editor or a Markdown-enabled field, allowing for formatting like headings, lists, bold/italic text, etc.
    *   **Project (Optional)**: You can link the note to a specific project to keep it organized within that project's context.
    *   **Tags/Categories (Optional)**: Some systems might allow tagging for easier filtering and searching.
3.  **Save Note**: Click "Save" or "Create".

**Managing Notes:**
*   **Viewing/Editing**: Click on a note from the list to open its detailed view. From there, you can typically edit the title, content, and any associated project or tags.
*   **Deleting**: Notes can usually be deleted from their detail view or directly from the list (often with a confirmation step).
*   **AI Assistance**: Labnex may offer AI assistance for notes, such as refining content for clarity or structure. Look for an option like "Refine with AI" when creating or editing a note.

### Code Snippets

Code Snippets allow you to store, manage, and share reusable blocks of code. This is useful for frequently used functions, configuration examples, templates, or any code segment you might need again.

**Accessing Code Snippets:**
*   Navigate to the "Snippets" section from the main sidebar.
*   This page will list your saved code snippets, often with information like title, language, and associated project.

**Creating a New Code Snippet:**
1.  In the Snippets section, find a "Create Snippet", "New Snippet", or "+" button.
2.  Enter the snippet details:
    *   **Title**: A clear title for the snippet (e.g., "Python API Request Function", "React Button Component Example").
    *   **Language**: Select the programming language of the snippet (e.g., JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS). This enables syntax highlighting.
    *   **Code**: Paste or type your code into the code editor area.
    *   **Description (Optional)**: Briefly explain what the snippet does or its context.
    *   **Project (Optional)**: Link the snippet to a relevant project.
    *   **Tags/Categories (Optional)**: For organization and searching.
3.  **Save Snippet**: Click "Save" or "Create".

**Managing Code Snippets:**
*   **Viewing/Editing**: Open a snippet to view its details, including the highlighted code. You can edit all fields from this view.
*   **Copying Code**: Snippets usually have a quick "Copy Code" button.
*   **Deleting**: Snippets can be deleted, typically with a confirmation.
*   **AI Assistance**: Labnex may offer AI assistance for code snippets, such as cleaning up the code, fixing errors, or suggesting improvements. Look for options like "Cleanup with AI" or "Fix Errors with AI" when creating or editing a snippet.
*   **Syntax Highlighting**: The code editor and viewer will apply syntax highlighting based on the selected language for better readability.

By using Notes and Code Snippets effectively, you can build a valuable knowledge base for yourself and your team, improving efficiency and consistency across your projects.
