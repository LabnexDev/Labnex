## Project Management in Labnex

Labnex provides robust tools for managing your software development projects from inception to completion. This guide covers key aspects of project management within the platform.

### Creating a New Project

1.  **Navigate to Projects**: From the main sidebar, click on "Projects".
2.  **Initiate Creation**: Look for a "Create Project", "New Project", or "+" button, usually prominently displayed on the Project List page.
3.  **Enter Project Details**:
    *   **Project Name**: A clear, descriptive name for your project (e.g., "E-commerce Platform Revamp", "Mobile App v2.0"). This is usually required.
    *   **Description**: (Optional but recommended) A brief overview of the project's goals, scope, or purpose.
    *   **Project Status**: (Optional) You might be able to set an initial status (e.g., "Active", "Planning"). Often defaults to "Active".
    *   Other fields might include setting a project lead or defining initial project dates, depending on Labnex's specific features.
4.  **Confirm Creation**: Click "Create" or "Save Project".

Your new project will now appear in your project list.

### Viewing Project Details

*   From the Project List page, click on any project name to navigate to its **Project Details** page.
*   This page typically shows:
    *   Project name, description, status.
    *   Key statistics (e.g., number of tasks, test cases, members).
    *   Lists of associated items like tasks, test cases, notes, and snippets.
    *   Team members involved in the project.
    *   Activity feed specific to the project.

### Editing a Project

1.  Navigate to the **Project Details** page of the project you wish to edit.
2.  Look for an "Edit Project", "Settings", or gear icon.
3.  You can typically update the project name, description, status, and other configurable fields.
4.  Save your changes.

### Managing Project Members and Roles

Effective collaboration relies on managing team members and their access levels within a project.

1.  **Accessing Team Management**:
    *   On the **Project Details** page, find a section or tab labeled "Team", "Members", or "Access Management".

2.  **Inviting Members**:
    *   Look for an "Invite Member" or "Add User" button.
    *   You can usually invite users by their Labnex username or email address.
    *   When inviting, you'll often assign an initial **role** to the user for that specific project (e.g., Tester, Developer, Viewer).
    *   The invited user will typically receive a notification and may need to accept the invitation.

3.  **Project Roles**:
    Labnex uses a role-based access control (RBAC) system to define what actions users can perform within a project. Common roles might include:
    *   **Project Owner**: Full control over the project, including managing members, editing project details, and deleting the project.
    *   **Test Manager**: Can manage test cases, assign testers, and view results.
    *   **Tester/Developer**: Can create and update tasks, execute test cases, create notes/snippets.
    *   **Viewer**: Read-only access to project information.
    *   *(Refer to the specific "Role Definitions" in Labnex or ask your administrator for precise permissions associated with each role.)*

4.  **Changing Roles / Removing Members**:
    *   In the team management section, Project Owners (and sometimes other privileged roles) can typically change a member's role or remove them from the project.

### Project Status (Active/Inactive)

*   Projects can often be marked as "Active" or "Inactive" (or similar statuses like "Archived", "Completed").
*   Inactive projects might be hidden from default views or have certain actions restricted, helping to keep your workspace focused on current work.
*   This status can usually be changed by the Project Owner from the Project Details or Edit Project page.

By utilizing these project management features, you can keep your projects organized, your team aligned, and your development process transparent.
