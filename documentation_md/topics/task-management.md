## Task Management in Labnex

Effective task management is crucial for project success. Labnex provides a comprehensive suite of tools to create, assign, track, and manage tasks throughout their lifecycle. Tasks are typically managed within the context of a specific project.

### Accessing Tasks

*   **Project-Specific Tasks**: Navigate to a project's details page and then to its dedicated "Tasks" page (usually via a "View Tasks" button). Tasks are typically displayed as a grid of cards.
*   **My Tasks Page**: Accessible from the main sidebar, the "My Tasks" page consolidates all tasks assigned to you across all your projects, providing a personal to-do list with filtering and sorting options, also displayed as a grid of cards.

### Creating a New Task

This is typically done from a specific project's Tasks page:

1.  **Initiate Creation**:
    *   On the project's Tasks page, look for a "Create New Task" or similar button.
    *   A modal or form will appear to enter task details.
2.  **Task Details**: 
    *   **Title** (Required): A concise and clear summary of the task (e.g., "Implement user login API").
    *   **Description** (Optional but highly recommended): Detailed information about the task.
    *   **Project**: Pre-selected based on the current project context.
    *   **Status**: The current state of the task. Defaults to `To Do`. Available statuses:
        *   `To Do`
        *   `In Progress`
        *   `Blocked`
        *   `In Review`
        *   `Done`
        *   `Cancelled`
    *   **Priority**: The urgency of the task. Defaults to `MEDIUM`. Available priorities:
        *   `LOW`
        *   `MEDIUM`
        *   `HIGH`
    *   **Assigned To** (Optional): Select a project member to assign the task to.
    *   **Due Date** (Optional): A target completion date.
    *   **Linked Test Cases** (Optional): Associate existing test cases from the current project with this task.
3.  **Save Task**: Click "Create" or "Save".

### Viewing and Editing Tasks

*   **Task Cards**: Tasks are displayed as cards, showing key information like title, status, and priority. Additional details like assignee, due dates, and linked test cases may also be visible on the cards.
*   **Editing Tasks (Project Tasks Page)**: Clicking on a task card on the project's Tasks page typically opens a modal where you can edit all its fields (title, description, status, priority, assignee, due date, linked test cases), provided you have permissions.
*   **Navigating from "My Tasks"**: Clicking on a task card on the "My Tasks" page will navigate you to the main Tasks page for that task's project.
*   Changing the **status** is a common action and reflects the task's progress.

### Key Task Management Features

*   **Filtering** (especially on "My Tasks" page):
    *   Filter tasks by Project, Status, and Priority.
*   **Sorting** (especially on "My Tasks" page):
    *   Sort tasks by Date Created, Due Date, and Priority.
*   **Task Views**: Tasks are generally displayed in a grid or list format. *A Kanban-style drag-and-drop board view is not a standard feature at this time.*
*   **Linking to Test Cases**: Essential for quality assurance. Tasks can be directly linked to test cases from the same project.

### "My Tasks" Page

This dedicated page is your personal productivity hub:

*   Lists all tasks assigned to **you** across all projects you're a member of.
*   Offers filtering (by project, status, priority) and sorting options (by creation date, due date, priority).
*   Task cards provide quick navigation to the parent project's main Tasks page.

By effectively using Labnex's task management features, you can ensure clarity, accountability, and smooth progress for all your project deliverables.
