## Creating Your Labnex Account

Welcome to Labnex! Setting up your account is the first step towards streamlining your project management and development workflow. Follow these simple steps to register:

1.  **Navigate to the Registration Page**:
    *   Open your web browser and go to the Labnex application.
    *   Click on the "Register" or "Sign Up" link, usually found on the login page or in the header.
    *   Alternatively, you can go directly to `[Your Labnex URL]/register` (e.g., `http://localhost:5173/register`).

2.  **Fill in Your Details**:
    *   **Name**: Enter your full name or a display name.
    *   **Email**: Provide a valid email address. This will be used for login, notifications, and account recovery.
    *   **Password**: Choose a strong, unique password. We recommend a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
    *   **Confirm Password**: Re-enter your chosen password to ensure it matches.

3.  **Review and Accept Terms** (if applicable):
    *   If presented, please read through the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
    *   Check the box to indicate your agreement.

4.  **Complete Registration**:
    *   Click the "Register" or "Create Account" button.

5.  **Verify Your Email Address** (Recommended):
    *   Check your email inbox for a verification message from Labnex.
    *   Click the verification link in the email to confirm your email address and activate your account fully.
    *   If you don't see the email, check your spam or junk folder.

Once these steps are completed, you can log in to Labnex using your email and password on the Login page.

### Troubleshooting

*   **Email already registered?** If you see this error, an account with that email already exists. Try logging in or use the "Forgot Password" option.
*   **Password requirements not met?** Ensure your password meets the specified criteria for length and character types.
