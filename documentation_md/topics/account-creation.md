## Creating Your Labnex Account

Welcome to Labnex! Setting up your account is the first step towards streamlining your project management and development workflow. Follow these simple steps to register:

1.  **Navigate to the Registration Page**:
    *   Open your web browser and go to the Labnex application. The URL will typically be `https://labnexdev.github.io/Labnex/`.
    *   Click on the "Sign Up" or "Register" link, usually found on the login page (if you're logged out) or in the main navigation if a direct link is provided.
    *   Alternatively, you can go directly to `https://labnexdev.github.io/Labnex/register`.

2.  **Fill in Your Details**:
    *   **Full name**: Enter your full name or a display name.
    *   **Email**: Provide a valid email address. This will be used for login and important account-related communications.
    *   **Password**: Choose a strong, unique password. Your password must be at least 6 characters long. We recommend a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols for better security.
    *   **Confirm Password**: Re-enter your chosen password to ensure it matches.

3.  **Complete Registration**:
    *   Click the "Create Account" button.

Upon successful registration, you will be automatically logged in and redirected to your Dashboard. You may also receive a welcome email from Labnex.

### Troubleshooting

*   **Email already registered?** If you see this error, an account with that email already exists. Try logging in using that email or use the "Forgot Password" option on the login page.
*   **Passwords do not match?** Ensure the password and confirmed password entries are identical.
*   **Password requirements not met?** Remember, your password must be at least 6 characters long.
